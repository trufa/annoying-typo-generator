Annoying typo generator
=======================

Google-chrome extension that interacts with the text areas and inputs of any page you go to. 

As you type it will seamlessly produce typos.

The kind of errors it will randomly produces are:

 - change one character to a character close in the keyboard
 - ignore the space keypress
 - duplicate a key stroke
 - ignore a keystroke

It will basically annoy the hell out of anyone that has this installed.

*Note: it will not interact with the inputs with the type parameter set to password, this is to allow any unknowing user to login anywhere.*
